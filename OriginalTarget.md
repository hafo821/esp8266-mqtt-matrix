#Very first goal:

  My original idea was to make the visual notification of an incoming email or new telegram message, so while im coding for uni(yeah!) or   studing, i can know whether i got a good mark on Algorithms and Data Structure,
  or if my brother is waiting outside home waiting me to come and open the door(i like to listen music, it keeps the thinking rhythm up).
  
  Anyhow i decided to integrated with my openhab iot system (controls my bedroom lights), its ok like that but i thought it would be cool to display messages to my brother(lol).
  Thats when i started to look for a good implementation, and i remembered esp is capable of web serving, but there is where my problems started i could not find the way to pass information 
  from the web to the code without html+javascript, and for that i need an sdcard, so while i whait for the module, i decided to maka a simpler solution
  with serial, not a neat solution but enough for the 4 or 5 days it takes to the sd module to arrive.foward step is to integrate three things into one.
